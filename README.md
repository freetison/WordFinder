# WordFinder

There are two simple projects as a demonstration of two different ways to solve the problem.
It shows the number of times the words are repeated and shows the output of the Find () method ordered by highest frequency.

In one project a simple comparison of nodes in two directions is used (faster), while in the other the entire original matrix is ​​rotated and added to itself to achieve 128 (horizontal) rows.

The performance of the first algorithm is between 8x -10x faster.

Just as a demo I used a fluent builder pattern, some interfaces and extensions to make the code easier to read.
Thanks
